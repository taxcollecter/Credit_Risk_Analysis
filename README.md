# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the Credit Risk analysis
Using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we leveraged a series of sampling strategies coupled with the Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble Classifiers to predict credit risk. We were tasked with and will provide an evaluation of the performance of the models while providing a recommedation on if the models should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

## Summary
In summary, we've found that the "City type" has a significant impact on the fare value collected by the driver and subsequently the company. We advise the company to prioritize Rural trips as they are more lucrative from a fare perspective. While this is a difficult ask considering the number of rides occurring within the Urban setting, especially from a staffing perspective, the Rural and Suburban areas offer a better ROI.
